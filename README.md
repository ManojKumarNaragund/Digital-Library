## Digital Library Project Overview

The Digital Library project aims to provide a comprehensive platform for managing and accessing digital resources such as books, articles, journals, and other educational materials. Users can browse, search, and access digital content conveniently through a user-friendly web interface.

### Technologies Used

- Java: Used for backend development, including business logic and data processing.
- JSP (JavaServer Pages): Used for dynamic web page generation.
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Used for structuring the web pages.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used for styling the web pages and enhancing the user interface.
- MySQL: Used as the database management system for storing and retrieving digital content, user information, and other relevant data.
- Tomcat Server: Hosts the website locally for development and testing purposes, ensuring smooth navigation and interaction.
- WampServer: Integrates Apache, MySQL, and PHP, providing a comprehensive environment for backend development, including database management and server-side scripting.
- Dreamweaver: Serves as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for designing visually appealing and functional web pages, streamlining the coding process.
- JDK (Java Development Kit): Provides essential tools and runtime environments for developing and running Java applications, including frontend and backend functionalities.

### Installation 
 [Installation Link](https://github.com/ManojKumarNaragund/Digital-Library-Installation-Application)
To set up the Digital Library project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) for Java development.
2. Install Tomcat Server to host the website locally.
3. Leave all the setting default.
4. Install WampServer to integrate Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
5. Use MySQL ODBC to establish connectivity between the Java-based application and the MySQL database.
6. Use Dreamweaver as the IDE for frontend design and development.
7. Use the serial number for licence.
8. Set up the project environment and configure the necessary settings.

### Setup and run
1. Set up java Global environment.
2. Download the Digital Library file and paste the folder to this path C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\webapps\ROOT in root folder digital library should be available.
3. Open WampServer > php myadmin.
4. Now Import the database from database folder select Sql file.
5. Open window type Configure Tomcat > Run as Administator.
6. If the tomcat is already running okay, else click on the start.
